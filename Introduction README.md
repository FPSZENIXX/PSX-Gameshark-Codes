Hi there , I have spent many years learning hexadecimimal 
and have been collecting various gameshark codes so thought 
it would be convenient for them to be in one place, I am 
constantly testing them to make sure they are working feel
free to copy and paste them in your own emulator and even
adapt them for yourself.

Thanks
